                    <p>Should you require your site to have more than 5 pages or additional functionality, feel free to contact me and we can discuss your needs.</p>
                    <p>EXCLUSIONS: Please note your website will need to be hosted on a web server. You will need to purchase a hosting package for this. I would recommend looking at <a href="https://www.hostafrica.co.za" target="_blank">Host Africa</a> as well as <a href="https://www.afrihost.com" target="_blank">Afrihost</a> for good deals. Typically, hosting will cost around R50-100/month. You will also need to purchase and register a domain, for example 'www.xyzcoaching.co.za'. This can be done fairly cheaply, through the sites mentioned above. I am more than happy to help you with this should you require assistance!</p>
                    <p>Interested? Read through the terms and conditions below and then get in touch with me by filling out the contact form at the bottom of the page:</p>
                    <h4>Terms, Conditions and Process</h4>

                        <p>1. This offer is made to you, the ‘Coach’ by New Insights Coaching & Communication (’New Insights’). The basic offer as explained on https://kc-designs.github.io/coaching-package does not include domain name research or registration, a web hosting package or ongoing site maintenance after completion of the build, although KC Designs can provide advice and/or assistance in this regard if required.<br><br>

                        2. Website design services are provided by KC Designs and any communication regarding your design and build requirements should be directed to KC Designs, not New Insights. A contact form has been provided, for this purpose, on https://kc-designs.github.io/coaching-package<br><br>

                        3. Should you require additional pages or functionality than that provided for in the basic offer as outlined on https://kc-designs.github.io/coaching-package KC Designs will advise you of any additional costs involved.<br><br>

                        4. Once you have agreed the scope and cost of your design requirements with KC Designs please place a firm order as follows: 
                        – eMail support@new-insights-africa.com with ‘Order for Website’ in the subject line
                        – Confirm the  scope and cost that you agreed with KC Designs in the body of the email.
                        – Also in the body, state “I hereby agree to the Terms, Conditions and Process as outlined on the KC Designs website”.<br><br>

                        5. KC Designs will advise you once the website has been built and you will have seven days within which to accept the design as final or request reasonable revisions in line with your stated requirements. Once these have been completed, further revisions will only be entertained if they involve the correction of errors or problems or requests that were overlooked by KC Designs.<br><br>

                        6. Once you are happy with the final design you will be required to confirm this with KC Designs who will inform New Insights. New Insights will then issue an invoice for the services rendered. Payment then becomes due to New Insights within seven days.</p>
